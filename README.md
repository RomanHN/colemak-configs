# Colemak configuration files

After the initial learning phase, the most inconvenient part about using an alternative keyboard layout like [Colemak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colemak) is having to remap keyboard shortcuts for different applications. In many cases, this isn't necessary, but if the keyboard location of an application's bindings matters (like in Vim), they will be designed for the Qwerty layout by default. This repository is my collection of configuration files to make it easier to set up Colemak-centric bindings.

## ["Vim Shortcuts" Logseq plugin](logseq-plugin-vim-shortcuts)

Replace `.logseq/settings/logseq-vim-shortcuts.json` with [my modified configuration file](./configs/logseq-vim-shortcuts).
