# Colemak configuration files

After the initial learning phase, the most inconvenient part about using an alternative keyboard layout like [Colemak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colemak) is having to remap keyboard shortcuts for different applications. In many cases, this isn't necessary, but if the location of an application's bindings on the keyboard matters (like `hjkl` in Vim), it will be designed for the Qwerty layout by default. This repository is my collection of configuration files that remaps keyboard bindings to match the key locations in Colemak.

## ["Vim Shortcuts" Logseq plugin](logseq-plugin-vim-shortcuts)

Replace `.logseq/settings/logseq-vim-shortcuts.json` with [my modified configuration file](./logseq-vim-shortcuts.json).
